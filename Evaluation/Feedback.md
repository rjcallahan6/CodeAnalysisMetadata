## Files & Changed Files
* Only required files committed
* Proper files changed

## Build
* Successfully builds, no errors, no warnings

## Test
* Passes all user tests
* Lots of extraneous output. The testing was to be automated with the ```assert()``` used to check for proper results.

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis\_t.cpp
* Fails a few tests in the oracle test suite with student's implementation. Mostly ```code_analysis()``` return values.

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis.cpp
* Fails an early test in the student's test suite with oracle implementation

## Code
* Necessary code is present
* The final return statement is indented wrong in all three functions
* A final return is not necessary if there is an if-then-else with returns in both cases
* Use of blank lines is not consistent

## Test Cases
* Not really a set of test cases, just a long string of output. This is a major issue.

## Literal Values used in Testing
* Realistic values used based on the problem description

## Error Messages
* Proper error messages
* Messages written to proper output

## Commits
* All commit versions build successfully
* In many cases, code that solves more than one test case is committed. Also problem of clarity of test cases.
